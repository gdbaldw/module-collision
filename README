module-collision simulates impacts having any 1D Constitutive, with dynamic and static friction coefficient as any function of velocity, for each of N-pairs of collision bodies within a collision world. The module is available at https://github.com/gdbaldw/module-collision and a demonstration video is available at https://youtu.be/8TlC2ZT-VMA.

Prerequisites:
- For mbdyn v1.7, the accompanying patch to rodj is required.
- libBullet must also be installed.

For both Debian and Ubuntu, the following configuration line works.

./configure --enable-runtime-loading --with-module="inline_friction collision" LDFLAGS="-rdynamic -lBulletSoftBody -lBulletDynamics -lBulletCollision -lLinearMath" CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/bullet
