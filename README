module-collision simulates impacts having any 1D Constitutive, with dynamic and static friction coefficient as any function of velocity, for each of N-pairs of collision bodies within a collision world. The module is available at https://github.com/gdbaldw/module-collision and requires installation of the fork of fcl available at https://github.com/gdbaldw/fcl. BlenderAndMBDyn is recommended, available at https://github.com/gdbaldw/BlenderAndMBDyn.

As of 6 JAN 2016, only Sphere and Plane shapes are tested. All other shapes must be vetted, and will require edits to this fork of fcl.

For both Debian and Ubuntu, the following configuration line works:

./configure --enable-runtime-loading --with-module="collision" LDFLAGS="-rdynamic -lfcl"
