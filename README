module-collision simulates impacts having any 1D Constitutive, with a dynamic and static friction coefficient as any function of velocity, for each of N-pairs of collision bodies within a collision world. The module is available at https://github.com/gdbaldw/module-collision and requires the Flexible Collision Library, available as a Debian package or from its source here, https://github.com/flexible-collision-library. BlenderAndMBDyn is recommended, available at https://github.com/gdbaldw/BlenderAndMBDyn.

As of 13 JAN 2016, only Sphere and Plane shapes are integrated and tested. A demonstration video is available at https://youtu.be/nigfe1SM4E4 . All other fcl shapes require integration into the files intersect.cc/h.

For both Debian and Ubuntu, the following configuration line works:

./configure --enable-runtime-loading --with-module="collision" LDFLAGS="-rdynamic"
